This is a Nibbles type game for two to four players. Each player controls a moving beam that can turn left or right, and a trail is left behind when the beam moves. Players navigate the beams avoid crashing into other beams and the border. The lone surviving player wins the game.

## About the game and its development

This was an attempt at the end of 1996 to create a game using Pascal. QuickPascal was chosen as the platform because itâ€™s graphics capability is superior to Turbo Pascal.
