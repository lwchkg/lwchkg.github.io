Teams Assignment Explorer is a Windows desktop program to help you mark Microsoft Teams assignments in your PC.
See the following video for a demo of the program.

(Note: please keep the captions on because I did not speak in the video.)

## Why this program?

In Microsoft Teams, we are supposed to view and annotate assignments in an integrated interface.
Unfortunately, editing or annotating assignments is limited to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote.

But for complex assignments (consider math and chemical equations), it is still preferred to write
on actual paper and upload by scanning to PDFs. In this way, it is impossible to mark assignment
inside Teams interface.

Teachers finally have found a way to annotate on those PDFs: using the OneDrive app on mobile
devices. However, the interface is so cluttered that about 5-10 clicks are needed to open each file:

*Libraries → [name of class] → Student work → Submitted files → **[name of student]** → **[name of
homework]** → [version number] → [name of the file]*

Imagine your class having 200 assignments at the end of the year. This is **unacceptable**. Hence
this program is here.
