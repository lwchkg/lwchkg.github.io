## About myself

My name is LEUNG Wing Chung. (Note that Leung is the surname.) I am a computer hobbyist that started programming in 1992, at the age of 12. You can see my programs in this web site.

I am also a bronze medal winner of the International Mathematical Olympiad (see my [official profile](https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=4788)).


## Why the web site

The web site is meant to publicize the presence of its owner, lwchkg, in the field of computer programming. Currently, the web site will host mainly my unpublished programs.

I want to find a full-time job in software engineering in the U.S. and need a recommendation. I hope that this web site is good enough to attract the attention of potential employers.

Note: I am currently teaching Mathematics and Computer in a secondary school in Hong Kong.


## Where is my CV?

This web site is supposed to be be my CV (except work experience) and it should give you an idea what I am capable of. Of course you may ask for a formal CV by e-mail to lwchkg@gmail.com
