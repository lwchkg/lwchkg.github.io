## About myself

My name is Wing Chung LEUNG. (Note that Leung is the surname.) I am a computer hobbyist that started programming in 1992, at the age of 12. You can see my programs in this web site, or at my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/lwchkg/){:target="_blank"}.

I participated in the [Google Code Jam](https://zibada.guru/gcj/profile/lwchkg){:target="_blank"} from 2016 to 2022, and fortunately got a few T-shirts.
My best result was rank #129 in Code Jam 2022 RoundÂ 3.

I am also a bronze medal winner of the International Mathematical Olympiad (see my [official profile](https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=4788){:target="_blank"}).

I can be contacted by e-mail to lwchkg@gmail.com. Requests for CVs are welcome if you have a project for me to join.
