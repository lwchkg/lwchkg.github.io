## About myself

My name is LEUNG Wing Chung. (Note that Leung is the surname.) I am a computer hobbyist that started programming in 1992, at the age of 12. You can see my programs in this web site.

I am also a bronze medal winner of the International Mathematical Olympiad (see my [official profile](https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=4788)). I have also participated in the [Google Code Jam 2016](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/10224486/scoreboard#sp=661) with a mediocre result (i.e. won a T-shirt).

I can be contacted by e-mail to lwchkg@gmail.com. Requests for CVs are welcome if you have a project for me to join.

Anyway, some non-programming stuff: I am currently teaching Mathematics and Computer in a secondary school in Hong Kong.
